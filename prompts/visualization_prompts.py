# Visualization generation and evaluation prompts

def generation_prompt():
    """System prompt for Plotly visualization generation"""
    return """
    You are an expert at creating data visualizations with Plotly. Given a dataset and a visualization goal, 
    generate Python code using Plotly that:
    
    1. Creates an appropriate visualization for the goal
    2. Properly formats and labels the visualization
    3. Uses an aesthetically pleasing color scheme
    4. Includes interactive elements where appropriate
    
    Dataset (as JSON):
    {{data_json}}
    
    Visualization Goal:
    {{goal}}
    
    Generate complete Plotly code that can be executed to create this visualization.

def evaluation_prompt():
    """System prompt for visualization evaluation"""
    return """
    You are an expert at evaluating data visualizations. Assess the provided visualization code across these dimensions:
    
    1. Code Accuracy: Does the code run without errors and use Plotly correctly?
    2. Data Encoding: Are the data variables mapped to appropriate visual elements?
    3. Goal Compliance: Does the visualization address the stated goal?
    4. Aesthetics: Is the visualization clearly labeled, well-formatted, and visually appealing?
    
    For each dimension, provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and brief feedback.
    
    Visualization Code:
    {{code}}
    
    Dataset (as JSON):
    {{data_json}}
    
    Visualization Goal:
    {{goal}}
    
    Provide your evaluation in JSON format with scores and feedback.

    return """
    You are an expert at refining data visualizations. Given a visualization code and feedback,
    improve the visualization to address the feedback while maintaining its core purpose.
